# Codecademy Challenge Project: Find Your Hat

## Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

### Prerequisites

In order to start this project, you should have completed lessons at least through Classes in our Introduction to JavaScript curriculum.

In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game with JavaScript classes. Because the goal involves user input, make sure you read our guide on working with user input in Node.js. If you complete this project on our platform, you can test and run your code with the command node main.js in our terminal.

Watch this video to get a sense of what you’ll be building:

### Extra challanges

If you’d like to extend your project past our requirements, here are a few ideas:

[x] Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.
[ ] Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
[x] Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. There are many helpful packages to assist with this, and you can really get creative with how you approach terminal games.
[x] Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. This might be pretty difficult! You’ll essentially be creating a version of a maze solver.
